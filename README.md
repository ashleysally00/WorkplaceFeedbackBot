To use the Reddit API, you need to **create a Reddit Developer account** and generate API credentials.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ashleysally00/WorkplaceFeedbackBot.git
cd WorkplaceFeedbackBot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```sh
python -m venv workbot_env
source workbot_env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
workbot_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a .env File & Add Reddit API Credentials

1. Create a .env file in the project folder.
2. Add the following, replacing with your own Reddit API credentials:

```sh
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent
```

### 4. Run the Data Collection Script

```sh
python reddit_data_collector.py
```

This fetches Reddit posts and saves sentiment data to reddit_workplace_sentiment.csv.

### 5. Run Sentiment Analysis & Visualization

```sh
python reddit_sentiment_analysis.py
```

This analyzes sentiment trends and visualizes workplace discussions.

## Customizing Your Analysis

By default, WorkplaceFeedbackBot analyzes posts from the following subreddits:
```python
subreddits = ["careerguidance", "jobs", "humanresources", "productivity"]
```

### Change Subreddits
To analyze different communities, edit reddit_data_collector.py and update this list:

```python
subreddits = ["your_subreddit_here", "another_subreddit"]
```

### Adjust the Number of Posts
By default, the bot collects 20 posts per subreddit:

```python
for post in subreddit.hot(limit=20):  # Change 20 to a higher/lower number
```

To fetch more data, increase the limit (e.g., limit=50).
To get only recent discussions, change .hot to .new:

```python
for post in subreddit.new(limit=20)
```
