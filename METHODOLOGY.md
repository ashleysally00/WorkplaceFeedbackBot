# **Understanding API-Based Data Retrieval & Text Mining**

Text mining and data retrieval are related but serve different purposes. Understanding the difference is important, especially in **AI, data analysis, or automation**.

## **1. Data Retrieval (Web Scraping vs. API-Based Collection)**

- **Definition:** Data retrieval involves extracting information from online sources. This can be done through **web scraping**, which parses raw HTML, or by using an **API** if the platform provides structured access to data.
- **Purpose:** To collect large amounts of data for analysis, research, or automation.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Web Scraping** – Extracting data from web pages using libraries like **BeautifulSoup or Scrapy**.
  - **API-Based Collection** – Retrieving structured data through **official APIs**, when available.
- **Example:**
  - **Web Scraping:** Collecting product prices from e-commerce websites by parsing HTML.
  - **API-Based Collection:** Fetching job postings from LinkedIn via an API.

## **2. Text Mining**

- **Definition:** Text mining (also called text analytics) is the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns, insights, or knowledge from **unstructured text data**.
- **Purpose:** To identify trends, sentiment, classifications, or relationships in text data.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (e.g., tokenization, stemming, named entity recognition)
  - **Sentiment Analysis** (e.g., determining if a review is positive or negative)
  - **Topic Modeling** (e.g., identifying common themes in documents)
- **Example:** Analyzing customer reviews to determine sentiment or extracting key phrases from legal documents.

## **Key Differences**

| Feature          | API-Based Data Retrieval | Text Mining             |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Focus**       | Data collection           | Data analysis           |
| **Data Type**   | Structured & unstructured | Unstructured text       |
| **Techniques**  | API requests              | NLP, machine learning, statistical analysis |
| **Purpose**     | Gathering data            | Understanding and analyzing text |

## **Application in This Project**

This project applies **API-based data retrieval** and **text mining** to analyze job-related discussions on Reddit.

### **API-Based Data Retrieval (Reddit Job Discussions)**
- Instead of scraping HTML, we used the **Reddit API** to collect structured data, such as **posts and comments** related to job sentiment.
- APIs provide a direct way to access platform data, making it **a structured approach** to retrieving relevant discussions.

### **Text Mining (Sentiment Analysis on Job Discussions)**
- Once we retrieve the text data, we apply **sentiment analysis** to classify job-related discussions as **positive, negative, or neutral**.
- Techniques like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **machine learning models**, and **pre-trained sentiment analysis tools** (e.g., **VADER** for social media text) help extract insights.

## **Project Implementation**

### **Why This Matters for Our Project**
- **The Reddit API provides structured access** to posts and comments, so traditional web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup are not required.
- The focus is on **text mining**, specifically **sentiment analysis**, to examine how people discuss jobs across subreddits.
- This approach allows us to analyze **large datasets** and identify sentiment trends in job-related discussions.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Reddit API** (via **PRAW** or **Pushshift.io** for historical data)
- **Python libraries:**
  - **NLTK/VADER** (for sentiment analysis on social media text)
  - **TextBlob or spaCy** (for additional NLP processing)
  - **pandas & matplotlib** (for data analysis and visualization)
