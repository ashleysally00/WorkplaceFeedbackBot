# Understanding Web Scraping and Text Mining

Text mining and web scraping are related but serve different purposes. Understanding the difference is important, especially if you're working with AI, data analysis, or automation.

## 1. Web Scraping

- **Definition**: Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves using tools or scripts to collect structured or unstructured information from web pages.
- **Purpose**: To gather large amounts of data from the web for analysis, research, or automation.
- **Techniques**:
- Using Python libraries like **[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)** or **Scrapy**
- Employing APIs (if available) instead of directly scraping HTML
- **Example**: Collecting product prices from e-commerce websites or extracting job postings from LinkedIn.

## 2. Text Mining

- **Definition**: Text mining (also called text analytics) is the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns, insights, or knowledge from unstructured text data.
- **Purpose**: To find trends, sentiments, classifications, or relationships in text data.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (e.g., tokenization, stemming, named entity recognition)
  - **Sentiment Analysis** (e.g., determining if a review is positive or negative)
  - **Topic Modeling** (e.g., identifying common themes in documents)
- **Example**: Analyzing customer reviews to determine product sentiment or extracting key phrases from legal documents.

## Key Differences

| Feature         | Web Scraping        | Text Mining            |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Focus**      | Data extraction      | Data analysis         |
| **Data Type**  | Structured & unstructured | Unstructured text |
| **Techniques** | HTML parsing, API requests | NLP, machine learning, statistical analysis |
| **Purpose**    | Collecting data      | Understanding and analyzing text |

## Application in This Project

Our project using the **Reddit API for sentiment analysis on jobs** combines both **web scraping** and **text mining**.

### Web Scraping (via the Reddit API)
- Instead of scraping HTML, we're using Reddit's API to **fetch posts, comments, or discussions** related to jobs.
- This is a structured way of retrieving data, similar to web scraping but more efficient and ethical since APIs provide official access.

### Text Mining (Sentiment Analysis on Job Discussions)
- Once we have the text from Reddit, we're applying **sentiment analysis** to classify whether discussions about jobs are positive, negative, or neutral.
- Techniques like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **machine learning models**, or **pre-trained sentiment analysis tools** (e.g., VADER for social media text) help extract insights.

## Project Implementation

### Why This Matters for Our Project
- We **don't need traditional web scraping tools** like BeautifulSoup since the **Reddit API provides structured access to posts and comments**.
- Our **main focus is text mining**, specifically **sentiment analysis**, which helps analyze how people feel about jobs based on discussions on Reddit.
- This approach is scalableâ€”we can pull **large datasets** and analyze job-related sentiment across different subreddits.

### Tech Stack
- **Reddit API** (via **PRAW** or `pushshift.io` for historical data)
- **Python libraries**:
  - **NLTK/VADER** (for sentiment analysis on social media text)
  - **TextBlob or spaCy** (for additional NLP processing)
  - **pandas & matplotlib** (for data analysis and visualization)
