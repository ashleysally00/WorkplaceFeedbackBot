careerguidance,Watching my dad and FIL 'age out' of their careers has me (31) terrified of the same fate. How do I avoid this?,"I've been wrestling with something that's been eating at me lately. I work in tech/product management, and I'm witnessing both my father and father-in-law go through what I can only describe as a slow-motion career crisis. Both are good workers, but they're stuck in this horrible limbo where they hate their jobs but are too scared to make any moves.
They're both dealing with this crushing loss of confidence as they age. Neither made it to executive levels - they were always solid middle-management types. But now they're just... existing. They come to work, keep their heads down, and pray they can hang on until retirement. They're terrified of being ""found out"" or pushed out, and they know their skill sets aren't competitive enough to easily land something new at their age.
Here's what's keeping me up at night: I'm only 31, but I'm terrified of ending up in the same position. I have a finance degree and work in product management, but watching them has made me realize that no field is immune to this. It feels like the only escape routes are:

Build something of your own
Climb high enough up the corporate ladder that you're ""untouchable""
Get lucky
Accept the same fate

I know I'm probably being paranoid given my age, but I can't shake this fear. I feel like I need to be doing something NOW to prevent this from happening to me in 20 years. But what? Keep learning new skills? Start a side business? Switch careers entirely?
Has anyone else dealt with this fear or watched their parents go through something similar? What moves can I make now to avoid this trap? Any advice from older tech workers who've successfully navigated this would be especially appreciated",-0.9685

careerguidance,Should I join the Navy/Airforce to fly. Or just go to civilian flight school instead?,"Howdy y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve wanted to fly for a long time. My end goal is to end up flying the airlines. 

But I‚Äôve been split recently if I want to take out loans and do civilian flight school, or go into the Navy or Airforce to fly. 

I‚Äôve spoken to officer recruiters from both branches. I got a 9 9 8 on the ATSB, I have a degree, and I‚Äôd be a competitive candidate for OTS/OCS. For a long time I wanted to fly in the military, specifically the Marines, but I want fixed wing, and my chances at fixed wing in the Marines are piss poor as there are few slots. So I decided it‚Äôd be between the Navy/Airforce. 

Flying fixed wing in any branch would be kick ass, especially if I end up in jets. My biggest issue is, it‚Äôs an 8-10 year minimum commitment after wings. That typically totals to around 12 years in service. Not only that, but the pay isn‚Äôt the best, and such a long service time, just to start at the bottom of the totem pole at an airline. 

Is it worth it to go the military route to fly? To the airlines even care if you have military flight experience? Or should I bite the bullet and go the civilian route? Cause life been told seniority is king in the airlines, unless it‚Äôs cargo. Thanks y‚Äôall! ",0.9124

careerguidance,Got rejected due to lack of authority and confidence?,"I have been searching for jobs as project manager since Christmas and got several interview with somewhat big firms. It usually ends up with only one interview (I usually have 1-2 meetings with recruiters first who have been contacting me on LinkedIn) before they explain that I got too little experience compared to what they are looking for.

This baffles me, since they know before the interview how long time I have been a project manager - so I don‚Äôt buy their excuse. 

The most recent interview process, I actually got to 3.interview after doing a case interview and then the personality test and skill test. My skill test was almost the best they had seen and above most of top leaders results, and the personality test showed no specific bad signs. I was 99% sure that I would get the job, but I got an email the day after telling me that I should have 1-2 more years experience. Again, they knew about my background before the interviews.

My previous manager is also working in the same firm, so I asked her for advise on why I get rejected all the time. She told me that there could be many reasons, but one of the things she noticed when interviewing me for the job that I got today, was that it seemed like I lacked confidence and authority. 

That was a huge eye opener for me and it honestly make me feel very embarrassed since I thought I was a good project manager that had good personality as a PM.

I applied for a sales job I‚Äôm honestly more than qualified for. I spoke to the recruiter and then had an in-person interview this past Wednesday afternoon with the hiring manager and 2 reps. There was one question I hesitated on because it really didn‚Äôt make sense but ended up giving an answer that they seemed to agree with. Other than that, I thought the interview went well. However, today (Saturday morning) I noticed the job had been reposted. Is this a bad sign? My husband thinks it was automated, that there‚Äôs no way they were able to give feedback on all of the candidates and repost the job in 2 short days.

Secondly, they use the STAR method for interviewing and while I left feeling confident, now I‚Äôm second guessing myself. Thinking back, a lot of their questions weren‚Äôt something like ‚Äútell me about a time when‚Ä¶.‚Äù. It was more general situational questions like ‚Äúhow do you handle having to do undesirable tasks that are required of the job‚Äù to which I answered something like ‚Äúunwanted tasks are just part of the job and I understand that most of them help me achieve my goal, so I do what‚Äôs expected of me under that understanding‚Äù.

However, once I finished school I fully regretted not doing something with direct patient care.

careerguidance,20M - How do I find a career when I feel like I don't fit in anywhere?,"I worked a year in digital marketing, SEO to be specific, but got layed off.

I got worried that AI will take over the jobs of the entire tech industry so I moved on to trades.

I did some painting, tile installation, plumbing and electrical as an apprentice but wasn't too happy with the work conditions and it wasn't something I can see myself doing untill I'm 65.

I just don't know what to do now? I can suck it up and just do tile installation but I think I should focus on finding something that I like doing, no?

I loved doing SEO but it seems so unstable, I can't imagine having a family and my source of income coming from such a unsecure industry.

What are some careers that are future proof, aren't hard on the body and that can pay well when you get good at them?

I can't describe how I'm feeling I'm the type of person that always needs to have his entire life planned out so not knowing which career to pursue is so bad for my mental health I can't even describe it.

The biggest problem is that I have imposter syndrome no matter what I do, when I was in trades I felt so out of place, like everyone was so much different and ""tougher"" than me. Marketing felt a lot more natural to me but what can I do.

The first place I worked at was a Retail Job it was a popular toy story is very popular and gets busy during the summertime and holidays. The job started well we had a really good crew but that was until majority of them left the crew that I had working there when I first started was the people there before COVID-19 pandemic had started and many of them decided to leave and find other professions or go back to school. This was during I guess it was called the ""Great recession"" era. A lot of people have left new people came in and this is when problems started to happen many of the coworkers were lazy didn't put any work in and was just talking and sitting around while other people were doing actual work. That's not the worst part.

A girl who worked at the company decided to get her boyfriend in the job since we were hiring two years ago guy got hired was a really good hard worker only problem was dude had serious attachment issues to her and got jealous when she was talking to other dudes and stuff like that. Dude crashed out one day almost caused a scene and fought a supervisor and got fired that wasn't the end of it. He was stalking her and tired coming back to the store many times until she quit and found a full-time job. Second story we had a married couple who worked there since 2017 they've been working there since they graduated high school long story short the guy was having affair with one of the supervisors and they were doing it in the store back of it once again it got bad to the point where some problems were having and the married guy had to quit probably because of black mail. 

You might be asking how I know this I was tight with two of the coworkers that had the same interest told me all of this the store has a clique group and talk about all of this I decided to quit because of being overworked and being understaffed when we need people the most during the weekends. Got treated terrible by the customers and coworkers at times wasn't valued either.

**Job # 2**     

I got this job back in December of 2023 I thought this job was going to be more professional than the retail gig and that wasn't the case at all I probably say it was even worse. I got hired as a Part-Time Note taker at a university if you don't know what that is you pretty much attend lectures (In-person and Remote) and take notes and help students with disabilities that have IEP's or 504 plans. Job looked good was something that I thought was going to be good until I realized how terrible management and the Community College was working at.   

For starters nobody in the department that I was working at didn't even bother to show up in the interview the director was supposed to be in the interview didn't know show up we did have an assistant director that showed up to the interview but found out on my first day that she quit her job and left a week before I came in. I applied for this job back in Oct of 2023 got hired at a week after doing in the interview and heard nothing about the position for about 5 weeks until Late December. Tired contacting the Director and was ghosted I sent about two emails after waiting 5 weeks to start orientation. Orientation was good then realizing the HR person that was helping me out was brand new barley started working there and many other people. 

For the first four weeks I didn't do anything related to my job title ""Note Taker"" I was pretty much doing Busy work for the Director and other full time Faculty Member. Was doing stuff that out of the Job Description and this was nothing like what they told me in the interview. Worst thing about it is that they try to make you do multiple jobs at once Like you have to be a note taker one day if a student is taking a test you need to be a proctor and then one day or you have to be A Scriber one day. Doesn't make any sense when you have separate job titles that only does that. 

Was treated terrible by the department was trying my best to get the work done despite the fact that it wasn't anything like what I signed up I was doing more other stuff then Note taking for the first 5 weeks. only three hours. I take the train it's over 45 min ride decided to do this for three weeks until I quit tired talking to the manager sending emails and trying to call him it was hard to get him in-person since he works remote and couldn't get anything was getting ghosted, I did had couple of classes that were remote. Found out one of the remote students I was helping out was blind didn't even find that out until I contacted the teacher, and the student finally reached out and told me. Told me that there was a Software that they used to help students who are impaired wasn't even trained on that at all tried contacting the director again was ghosted decided to quit was barley getting any hours and wasn't even being communicated?

Is this seriously how most jobs are now? I'm getting sick are tired of being ghosted and having terrible management who have no idea what they're doing or being terrible at their jobs. I know that not all places are like this, but this is BS. This is something that seriously needs to be addressed. I have a bad learning disability be up front on that so it's hard for me to learn things at first and need some practice but once I get it I can do it. Can't stand it just want to work freelancing, so I don't have to deal with this.",-0.9894

humanresources,SHRM CP tested in FL [N/A],"I have studied for 3 months straight using solely Angela Murray's HR exam prep. I have 5 years experience in HR as an HRBP and a Manager. I felt really prepared this morning and thought I would pass with no problem I get to the testing center and the lady who was running it was so rude and just outright mean she stressed me out and then the test exam itself was nothing that I had expected. Most of the questions were SJ questions and it seemed to me it was less knowledge-based but more SJ based I honestly did not have enough time to answer all of the SJ questions because they were extremely long and longer than the practice test questions I had experienced in my study materials. I was experiencing some test anxiety as I normally do but today as soon as I was about 20 minutes into the test I immediately began to have anxiety really bad and I think the lady at the test center did not provide a great experience at all for me. I feel so deflated I studied for so long and every night it was a commitment with challenges of family to teenage boys and just the normal routine of my job but I really put my all into studying and I was doing great on my quizzes and full length practice exams really grasping and retaining the entire strategic material. All of that time I felt was wasted to top it all off on Monday I have to go into work and tell my boss that I did not do well and I failed they just made it a requirement on my job description for having the Shrmm and now I feel like I'm going to lose my job or something where they're going to think that I am not worthy enough. I'm sorry if I sound so down I am just literally so sad that I did not pass the exam it was truthfully brutal and I flagged about 7 to 10 questions I never even got a chance to go back to completing because I ran out of time. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Now I am questioning if I should even stay in HR. Most of my HR positions have been operationally based mainly in recruitment and in this past year I have been involved in more strategic tasks but apparently even with my studying I devoted so much time too I couldn't pass the test today I don't know if I want to even retest but it seems like I might have to since now my job made it be a requirement on my job description.

In my letter, I wrote something like: ""While your qualifications are impressive, we‚Äôve chosen to move forward with a candidate whose experience more closely aligns with the role‚Äôs current needs.""  
  
I‚Äôll admit, it feels a bit impersonal. Could it have been more thoughtful and respectful?  
  
Should rejection letters include detailed feedback, or is brevity and professionalism the better route? Are we really helping candidates grow with these letters, or just checking a box to close the loop?

humanresources,Am I just a bad employee? - Starting to second guess my own work ability [N/A],"I started this new job less than a year ago as a HR Generalist and my reporting manager expects me to consistently remind her 4-5x a day to review and approve documents I drafted. Most of the time I would only remind at least once a day but still end up having the deadlines missed because she wouldn't review them when I asked. I also provide deadlines to her when she should get back to me but this would also be ignored. Reminders are sent via email, Teams messages and also in-person face-to-face.

During 1:1 meetings later, she would always blame me for not meeting deadlines although they were always up to her to review and approve/provide feedback. I mentioned this to her that I feel I shouldn't have to consistently remind her to do her part when I am also swamped with tasks of my own. She would just put me down and compare me to the previous person in my role who was always able to complete deadlines on time while reminding her what to do. I constantly feel undervalued and belittled because of this because I am very used to having managers who were good at getting back to me in a timely matter. She mentions I am not trying hard enough and that I should just try harder to organize myself more.

Is it normal to spend about 1/2 of your work time reminding your manager to do their part in order to complete tasks before a deadline? Is it true that I am not trying hard enough in this case? What tips could you provide me that could help me do better in this case?",0.6886
humanresources,Was anyone else shocked to see their Preliminary Pass for the SHRM-CP..? [USA],"Just finished my test, and got the preliminary pass! Hooray!

I used primarily the SHRM learning system for my studying and always found the questions to be pretty straightforward, the knowledge questions could be tough but I rarely thought twice about the SJI questions. 

I found the actual exam SJI questions to be really difficult!! So many of the options felt like the same thing, just reworded slightly. I used the full time for my second section just second guessing and switching several of my ‚Äúflagged‚Äù questions.

Hi all,

I have an employee who has been receiving a retention bonus for one of our clients. The contract specifies that the employee must remain active with the client in order to qualify for the bonus each year. However, the client has terminated the relationship before the scheduled end of their contract, which was supposed to conclude this year, and there is one final payment due as per the contract.

Given that the client has left before the contract's completion, are there any legal implications for us not paying out the retention bonus, considering the terms outlined in the contract stated the employee be actively working with the client?

humanresources,New Earned Sick Time in Michigan [MI],"

Next Friday, February 21st, Michigan‚Äôs new Earned Sick Time Act goes into effect. As of writing this, there‚Äôs still a chance the start date could be punted to mid-year, but it would be tricky for legislators to do that due to the Michigan Supreme Court Decision.

I‚Äôm trying to at least set up our HRIS system to accommodate the new act should it go into effect on the 21st. Worst case scenario it‚Äôs ready to go, hopefully, if it doesn‚Äôt start until later in the year.

Reading the FAQ‚Äôs, I‚Äôm confident our policy for Full Time Salary employees meets the requirements. It‚Äôs setting this up for PT hourly employees that I‚Äôm struggling with. It seems like we can just front load a prorated amount to start on 2/21, and have it reset every January 1st at 72 hours. However a part time employee (under 30 hrs) would never hit that amount if we went with an accrual policy. Therefore, we‚Äôd need to add the extra hours regardless. Likewise, if my math is right (and assuming we didn‚Äôt have a good PTO policy for Salary), a Full Time Salary employee would only hit about 69 hours. Our current policy for all Salary, in Michigan or working remotely in another state, gives them 120 hours prorated per calendar year.

It seems like just front loading the 72 hours for PT EE‚Äôs is the easiest administratively. And I‚Äôm leaning going that way. Does anyone have an argument as to why front loading wouldn‚Äôt be recommended, and we should do this as an accrual?

Regarding rollover (again, for Part Time), the law says that and remaining amount has to rollover to the following year. It also states that an employer can limit the usage to 72 hours per designated year. Therefore, if we just reset on 1/1 to 72 hours, even if they had 50 left to rollover, it wouldn‚Äôt matter, correct? We‚Äôd just limit to 72 hours for that calendar year, which they have at the very beginning.

Is anyone else in Michigan dealing with these issues and want to chime in on how they are handling it?",0.9598
humanresources,Passed SHRM CP 2/14/25 [N/A],"[N/A]

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience preparing for the SHRM-CP exam, especially for those who might not have access to the SHRM Learning System due to its cost. Here‚Äôs how I approached my study plan using alternative resources:

Study Resources:
	1.	Quizlet: I utilized free flashcards on Quizlet to grasp key definitions and concepts. It‚Äôs a great way to reinforce your memory on various HR topics.
	2.	Pocket Prep App: This app offers a plethora of practice questions that are perfect for studying on the go. While the questions are somewhat easier than the actual exam, they help build a solid foundation.
	3.	Etsy Study Guide: I found an affordable study guide on Etsy titled ‚ÄúYour Ultimate Guide to Ace the SHRM-CP Exam Exam Prep 2024-2025.‚Äù It provided in-depth notes and practice tests, breaking down complex topics into easily digestible content. This resource was a game-changer for me.

Study Routine:
	‚Ä¢	Duration: I dedicated about four months to studying.
	‚Ä¢	Schedule: Aimed for at least 2 hours of study time from Monday to Friday.
	‚Ä¢	Approach: I started by thoroughly reviewing all topics, taking detailed notes as if I was new to the material. After building a solid foundation, I took practice exams to identify weak areas and focused on those topics. I also used ChatGPT to generate questions on subjects I found challenging, which helped reinforce my understanding.
	‚Ä¢	Final Month: Focused on reviewing and solidifying my knowledge. The Etsy study guide was particularly useful during this time, offering numerous practice tests and concise summaries.

Exam Experience:
	‚Ä¢	Content Focus: The exam emphasized Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), ethics, and conflict management. Interestingly, there were no math questions, and it didn‚Äôt delve deeply into specific laws.
	‚Ä¢	Question Format: The Situational Judgment Questions (SJQs) were more straightforward than those in the practice tests.

Test-Taking Tips:
	‚Ä¢	Time Management: If you‚Äôre unsure about a question, make your best guess, flag it, and move on. This strategy ensures you don‚Äôt waste time and can revisit flagged questions if time permits.
	‚Ä¢	Stay Calm: Trust your preparation and maintain your composure during the exam. You‚Äôve put in the effort, and you‚Äôre ready to succeed.

I hope this helps, and good luck to everyone preparing for the exam! If I can do it.. YOU CAN! ",0.9944
humanresources,Interviewer Etiquette [N/A],"I‚Äôm concerned my HR Manager is being unprofessional in screenings and interviews. They frequently have screenings that go over two hours and refer to applicants having ‚Äúreally cool life stories‚Äù or similar family situations to them. I was curious how this comes up and it turns out they start their interviews by sharing their own life story. I think they know it‚Äôs wrong because they dont do it when a second interviewer is there.

This feels wrong to me. And inconsiderate to the applicant as their longest interviews have been with people who weren‚Äôt qualified for the role. We are a retail store, we do care a lot about who we hire but I believe sharing personal information opens up room for bias and discrimination.

I actually got that and became a high-paid employee (9-5 job!!), bought a nice car, and live alone in a large, comfortable apartment

But after that I discovered my emptiness and lack of discipline, and I also realized that I'm a dirty person. I take care of my personal hygiene every day more than once, but my apartment is like trash. I come home and there is food left over from two days ago that I did not even put in the trash. You cannot imagine how empty a person I am, I have no interests at all.

productivity,"Struggling with motivation? Me too, but here‚Äôs how I fixed it","Ok, so in this post, I want to first ask you guys reading this why you struggle with motivation and what you believe the causes are?

I also want to provide some insight on ways I've overcome a lack of motivation in my own life.

So let's get into it‚Ä¶

I remember a time where I was working as a realtor, sitting at my desk and basically falling asleep because of not having the energy to even move. Mind you, I was 18 years old at the time.

Now I have no problem cranking out 8-12 hour workdays, 6 days a week, while still hitting the gym and doing other activities I find fun.

I am in no way, shape, or form a 24/7 insane motivation, go-go-go guy, but over the past few years, I've found 6 things that drastically increased my motivation, productivity, and overall energy.

So there are 6 things I realized to get the motivation I needed to increase the production in my life.

1. Understand that motivation comes in seasons

The reality is you won‚Äôt be motivated all the time. For me, I've noticed that I get bursts of motivation followed by seasons of unmotivation, and that's completely normal. The key here is to expect that unmotivation will come and understand that it is part of the process. During these down times, I use books, podcasts, and learning to help me get inspired and re-spark the motivation I need. This is also a sign of your body telling you to cool off a bit, hang with friends, go for walks, and spend more time doing things you enjoy.

2. Work out / diet change

""Emotion is created by motion. The way you move your body affects the way you feel."" - Tony Robbins.

Referring back to the above where I stated I was an 18-year-old agent practically falling asleep at my desk, I was in an unhealthy state. I wasn‚Äôt working out, I was eating out all the time, and I can 100% confirm this had a major impact on my energy levels and motivation to do things. I was always tired and never felt like doing anything. Eat light meals throughout the day until later in the night, clean up your diet, and go to the gym. I can almost guarantee this will help you 10x your motivation. Bonus tip: stretch your body every day, if your body is tight, so is your mind.

3. Change your environment (physically and mentally)

One of the main reasons I lacked motivation was because I was in an environment of people who were comfortable. I was surrounded by people who didn‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything. Change your physical environment‚Äîfind people who are working towards something and hang out with them.

Also, change your mental environment‚Äîconsume information from people who will inspire you. I started listening to people who inspired me on podcasts, reading biographies, and watching YT videos of people I wanted to be like. Ed Mylett, Tim Ferriss, and Lewis Howes are great places to start.

4. Find someone to work with

I used to think being the solo guy who achieved everything by himself was cool. I was like, ""Yeah, I‚Äôll be like the lone wolf."" So, so stupid.

Find people who want to do the same thing as you (or something similar) and work with them, alongside them, or even consistently talk to that person about each other's progress‚Äîsomething to basically keep you accountable.

I've noticed that working with other people significantly increased my motivation because now I have others relying on me, and I really don‚Äôt want to let them down.

5. Input detox

We can now overstimulate our brains to the point of paralysis with the internet. You don‚Äôt feel like doing anything because your brain's reward system is so f‚Äôd up from TTok that a hot girl (or guy) calling you up to go out for drinks won‚Äôt even get you off the couch.

6. DO NOT SIT/LAY DOWN

Once your butt hits the couch or bed, it's game over. It will take you five times the energy to persuade yourself to get off the nice, soft, warm couch or bed. It sounds silly, but you should only be sitting on a comfy couch or lying in your bed once you‚Äôre done with everything you needed to do for the day. I truly believe the couch or bed will suck the motivation out of your body‚Äîyou‚Äôll just want to chill and be lazy. Again, it might sound pretty stupid, but just LISTEN TO ME.

Implementing these 6 things into your life will significantly increase your motivation, but the key here is consistency. Don‚Äôt expect that eating one clean meal, working out 1-2 times, and listening to a podcast is going to change everything. It‚Äôs a good start, but you‚Äôll need to do this on a daily basis.

Give it 2-3 weeks, and you‚Äôll be an entirely different person.

productivity,As a middle aged woman who's new to the online world I've recently had to learn a lot of new skills and I feel like I'm doing everything the long way - any tips for picking up new skills without wasting time or getting distracted?,"For example I've had to learn how to edit pictures and videos but I've found that I've wasted a lot of time just trying to work out what platforms/software to use, and then when I finally land on the right one I'll sit watching videos or reading guides and a lot of it is irrelevant to what I need to know or the title is misleading and it doesn't actually help. Usually when I find the right advice I can learn the skill or solve my problem quickly.

productivity,For people who spend too much time scheduling meetings‚Äîwould this make your life easier?,"I‚Äôve noticed that scheduling meetings, especially large ones with external people, takes way more effort than it should. In some industries, it‚Äôs normal to spend days going back and forth over email just to find a time that works.

I‚Äôve been working on a tool called MeetingHero that tries to speed up this process. Instead of endless email threads, it reads availability straight from emails‚Äîeven vague ones like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs free after 2 but prefers before 4‚Äù‚Äîfinds overlap, and lays it out in a calendar. The idea is to help people who deal with scheduling all the time, like executive assistants, junior bankers, and consultants.

productivity,Forty hours of work every week for many years is too much and a great pressure on the human body and mind.,"I don't think it's healthy at all for a person to be trapped at work 5 days a week, 8 hours a day, plus another two hours for preparation and commuting, and every minute of it you hate yourself. The employer controls when you eat, go to the bathroom, and even your healthcare. And we're supposed to do that for 40 years or more of our lives.

Even on weekends, you're so exhausted from work that you can't do anything, and on Sunday night, you get a very bad feeling and disgust from the work that's coming the next day. Some people are happy when they get injured so they can get paid while sitting at home, and that's pure madness.

We miss out on so many things that life can offer us, many hobbies and experiences, but we've all gotten used to the 40-hour work week so much that people are surprised when you say you don't like it.

Edit: Thanks for all the comments. It's good to know I am not alone in feeling this way.

productivity,"What are some products, services, or things that have significantly improved your life‚Äîand why?","I wanted to create a post where people can share things that make life easier for them. Some of these might seem obvious, but my hope is that by explaining why they‚Äôre helpful, others might be inspired to try them out, and share some other examples! 


1. My iPad

If you‚Äôre on the fence about getting an iPad or tablet‚Ä¶ just do it. The biggest advantage, in my opinion, is its portability and practicality. It‚Äôs much easier to carry around than a laptop, and having a larger screen on the go makes certain tasks way more efficient. I use a carrying case, mouse, keyboard, and ergonomic stand to give it more of a ‚Äúlaptop feel,‚Äù and I have to say, it has significantly improved my workflow over the years.

2. Apple Watch

At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I really needed an Apple Watch, but it has some great everyday advantages. A common argument I hear is, ‚ÄúWhy would I get one when my phone can do all the same things?‚Äù‚Äîwhich is fair. But the Apple Watch is great for quick actions when you don‚Äôt want to pull out your phone. I use it constantly for setting timers (super useful for cooking, the gym, laundry, etc.), tracking activity and heart rate, controlling music, finding my phone when I misplace it, and more. Plus, having Siri right on my wrist is pretty helpful. The way the ecosystem comes together has really worked for me‚Ä¶ but you can take the same principles and apply it to other systems if you prefer their interface instead. 

3. Apple Reminders & Calendar App

I know, another Apple example‚Äîbut for good reason! I use the Reminder and Calendar apps every single day. Whenever someone asks me to do something and I don‚Äôt want to forget, I set a quick reminder on my Apple Watch. It helps me stay organized and essentially acts as a running to-do list. I also use the MS To-Do app, but I find that better for long-term tasks that take weeks or months to complete. The Calendar app, on the other hand, is great for planning my day, week, or month.

4. Robot Vacuum

If you have pets or kids‚Ä¶ trust me, just get one. Some even have mopping features too. We set ours to run twice a week, and it really helps keep the floors tidy. We still do a deep clean every now and then, but it‚Äôs way less frequent thanks to the robot vacuum.

5. Mini Handheld Vacuum & Electronic Air Compressor

These are game-changers for quick cleanups. Having a small, powerful vacuum you can just grab for minor messes is so convenient. The air compressor is also great for things like cleaning keyboards or dusting off hard-to-reach spots.

6. Costco Membership

If you‚Äôve never been to Costco, you might not realize how much money it can save you. It‚Äôs perfect for stocking up on everyday essentials. For example, we bought a box of cling wrap for $10, and it has lasted years. The bulk savings make the membership well worth it, and their cashback feature helps it pay for itself if you shop there regularly.

7. YT Premium Membership

It has gotten ridiculously ad-heavy in recent years, and paying for Premium has been totally worth it for me. It has even replaced streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ because I can just watch content that actually interests me. Plus, the ability to listen in the background while using other apps is a huge bonus. If you find yourself getting frustrated with constant ads, I‚Äôd definitely recommend trying it out.

8. Syncing iCloud Drive to My Desktop

A lot of people don‚Äôt realize you can sync your iCloud Drive with a Windows computer to easily transfer files between devices. It‚Äôs not as seamless as AirDrop, but if you haven‚Äôt set this up yet, it‚Äôs definitely worth doing.

9. Visualizing Income & Expenses on My Calendar

Physically seeing my bills on my calendar has been a game-changer for budgeting. It helps me visualize how much money is going out bi-weekly and makes it easier to stay on track with saving. Also, if you haven‚Äôt already, automate your expenses‚Äîit makes life so much easier.

10. Gym Membership

This one is pretty obvious, but even on my worst days, I always feel better after a workout. It improves my mood, boosts my energy throughout the day, and even helps me think more clearly. If you‚Äôve been debating getting a membership, it‚Äôs 100% worth it.



Anywho, hopefully some of these help! I know some of them might seem pretty simple‚Ä¶ but I want to hear about ones for you that you think are important! Thanks for reading :) ",0.9997
productivity,"I hated everything about my mornings and the first hours of my day. I was unmotivated to do anything, to be honest. These simple things changed my life‚Äînot just my mornings.","1. **Get outside for 15 minutes with the first daylight** to regulate your melatonin (internal clock). If it‚Äôs already light outside and you walk to work, that‚Äôs enough.
2. **Exercise regularly -** our bodies are built for it (doesn‚Äôt need to be much). I personally started running a bit 3x a week. Most of the time, I also get my dose of sunlight this way. I think this has a huge impact on my hormones - it‚Äôs the only way I can explain why I feel great and motivated now. Before, I did no exercise because I ‚Äúhad no time.‚Äù

Doing just these two things helped me go from being an unmotivated office worker, hating the first hours of the day, to thriving at my 9‚Äì5 and even working on personal projects I‚Äôm passionate about in my free time. I also make time for family. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine getting this much done, seriously.

And here‚Äôs a bit more I‚Äôm still working on staying consistent with:

1. **A consistent sleep schedule -** ideally even on weekends, so you don‚Äôt disrupt your cycle.
2. **Avoid caffeine 10 hours before bed** so your body can actually rest. Just because you fall asleep doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs quality sleep.
3. **Limit harsh lights and screens at least 1 hour before bed -** dim the lights to signal to your body that it‚Äôs time to rest.
4. I started reading to fall asleep easier - after like 4 pages max I¬¥m out

Good luck, mate! For me, **morning sunlight worked wonders -** I‚Äôd at least try that one! I put more details on these tips over at r/mornincrew",0.9411
